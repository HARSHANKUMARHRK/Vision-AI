# Vision AI

## Overview
Vision AI is a project designed to assist blind and visually impaired individuals by providing easy navigation and situational awareness through advanced deep learning algorithms. This system uses object detection, scene description notifications, immediate alert sensing, and range finding to identify potential threats and anomalies. Additionally, it fosters community building by connecting users with a support network.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Recognizes and identifies objects in the user's environment.
- **Scene Description Notification**: Provides auditory descriptions of the surroundings.
- **Immediate Alert Sensing**: Detects and alerts users to immediate dangers or unusual situations.
- **Range Finder**: Measures distance to obstacles and identifies threats and anomalies in the environment.
- **Community Building**: Connects users with a community for support and information sharing.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Vision**: Utilized for its robust computer vision capabilities.
- **TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch**: Used for model development and training.
- **Custom Neural Networks**: Developed to handle specific tasks and improve system performance.

## Installation
To set up the Vision AI project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vision-ai.git
    cd vision-ai
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Object Detection**:
    ```python
    python object_detection.py --input path_to_image_or_video --output path_to_save_results
    ```

2. **Scene Description Notification**:
    ```python
    python scene_description.py --input path_to_image_or_video --output path_to_save_audio_description
    ```

3. **Immediate Alert Sensing**:
    ```python
    python alert_sensing.py --input path_to_real_time_feed --output path_to_save_alerts
    ```

4. **Range Finder**:
    ```python
    python range_finder.py --input path_to_real_time_feed --output path_to_save_results
    ```
